# **Catalyst by Experian ‚Äì App Flow, Pages & Roles**

## **Navigation Flow Summary**

Catalyst is a streamlined, no-login web simulation tool with a modular experience flow. It features a homepage hub (Scenario Control Room), a real-time simulation dashboard, and a post-simulation outcome brief.

All users access the same interface and toggle perspectives (CRO, Regulator, Investor) for different strategic interpretations‚Äîthere are no persistent roles or accounts.

## **Key Pages & Components**

### **1\. Scenario Control Room (Homepage)**

**Purpose:** Entry point for simulation sessions

**Components:**

* Experian-branded dashboard layout  
* Scenario tiles (e.g., ‚ÄúThe Exclusivity Gambit‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe Silent Revolt‚Äù)  
* Scenario preview modal (briefing \+ agent context)  
* CTA: ‚ÄúSimulate Strategic Impact‚Äù  
* Perspective toggle: sets initial lens (CRO, Regulator, Investor)

**Actions:**

* Select scenario ‚Üí move to dashboard  
* Choose initial lens (or default to CRO)

### **2\. Simulation Dashboard**

**Purpose:** Real-time modeling interface

**Components:**

* Node Map (visual layout of bureaus \+ roles)  
* Timeline of Moves (e.g., Proposal ‚Üí Threat ‚Üí Counteroffer)  
* Trust & Power Indicators (animated meters)  
* Move Input Panel (trigger next round)  
* Signal Cards (üü¢üü°üî¥ payoff indicators)  
* Regulatory Shock Sensor (if enabled)  
* Perspective Toggle (live-switch between CRO, Regulator, Investor)

**Actions:**

* Advance through predefined decision rounds  
* View signal effects on agent trust and system dynamics  
* Switch perspectives to view different summaries

---

### **3\. Outcome Brief / Simulation Summary**

**Purpose:** Display outcome and strategic recommendation

**Components:**

* Summary of all moves and reactions  
* Strategic Action Matrix (Impact √ó Probability)  
* Competitor Move Likelihood Heatmap  
* Suggested Experian Move  
* Risk vs. Gain Analysis (perspective-specific overlays)  
* Optional: Export or Save Brief (future roadmap)

**Actions:**

* Review final outcome based on all moves  
* Switch lens for summary interpretation

## **User Roles & Permissions**

### **No Account System ‚Äì Open Sandbox**

* No authentication, no saved user state  
* All users share the same access  
* Used primarily in workshops or solo sessions

### **Lens Perspectives (Toggleable)**

* **Chief Revenue Officer (CRO):** Focused on revenue, partner leverage  
* **Chief Risk Officer (Risk):** Focused on trust, regulatory stability  
* **Regulator:** Concerned with systemic risk, consumer fairness, oversight readiness  
* **Investor (Optional):** Focused on market perception and partner alliances

These lenses alter the framing and language of payoff signals and summary briefs‚Äîbut not the simulation logic itself.

## **Navigation & Interactivity Highlights**

* All flows are **one-session scoped** ‚Äî simulations reset when reloaded  
* Smooth transitions between rounds and summary views  
* Clicks and toggles emphasize narrative pacing, not data entry
