# **Catalyst by Experian ‚Äì Design Guidelines**

## **Visual Style Overview**

Catalyst is a cinematic, high-stakes simulation tool intended for executive audiences. Its aesthetic should feel polished, strategic, and slightly ominous‚Äîmirroring the invisible power shifts and ripple effects in data ecosystems.

Design should emphasize clarity, tension, and progression, using color, motion, and layout to convey real-time system dynamics.

## **Fonts**

* **Primary Font:** Montserrat (all weights)  
* **Usage:**  
  * Bold for action headers, metrics, and signals  
  * Regular for body text and decision rationale

## **Colors**

### **Primary (Trust, Strategy, Stability)**

| Color Name | Hex Code | Usage |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Safety Blue | \#004393 | Brand headers, stable states |
| French Blue | \#006eba | Backgrounds, UI elements |

### **Accent (Signals, Tension, Outcomes)**

| Color Name | Hex Code | Usage |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Mardi Gras Purple | \#851b7e | Rising tension, secondary UI accents |
| Red Violet | \#ce1e87 | Ecosystem risk, aggressive moves |
| Rose | \#fa2783 | Alerts, player move highlights |

### **Backgrounds and Neutrals**

| Color | Hex Code | Usage |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| White | \#ffffff | Page background |
| Light Grey (subtle) | \#f5f5f5 | Panel fills, card borders |

## **Layout System**

### **Modular Interface Design**

* Use card-based layouts for scenarios, moves, and outcomes  
* Employ a dashboard grid to manage spatial relationships  
* Support wide-screen layouts with central visual maps and sidebar actions

### **Simulation Dashboard Zones**

1. **Node Map View:** Visualizes bureaus and agent roles  
2. **Timeline Progression Bar:** Tracks key strategic moves  
3. **Payoff Indicators:** Uses color-coded status cards (üü¢üü°üî¥)  
4. **Perspective Toggle Panel:** Persistent switcher for Regulator, CRO, Investor

## **UI & Motion Principles**

### **Signal-Based Microinteractions**

* Trust breach \= flickering connection lines  
* Agent defection \= fracture animation between nodes  
* Isolation \= pulse dimming / fade of an agent

### **Scene-Like Transitions**

* Simulations feel like unfolding acts, with transitions between:  
  * Scenario ‚Üí Move Round ‚Üí Outcome  
* Use subtle fades and horizontal pans to create narrative weight

### **Risk Animations**

* Regulator Watch Alert \= pulsing red border \+ icon flash  
* High-risk move \= screen ripple \+ flash transition

## **Accessibility Considerations**

* All color-coded signals must have icon or label redundancy  
* Motion and animations should be toggleable or minimized for users with sensitivities  
* Text contrasts to meet WCAG AA+ minimums

## **Brand Tone / Narrative Voice**

* **Tone:** Analytical, strategic, quietly urgent  
* **Messaging Style:**  
  * Short, sharp headlines (e.g., ‚ÄúTrust Collapses‚Äù)  
  * Insight-driven summaries (e.g., ‚ÄúEquifax unlikely to walk‚Äîno alternate secured.‚Äù)  
  * Role-lens recommendations (‚ÄúAs a Regulator: prioritize stability over gain.‚Äù)

## **Iconography & Visual Cues**

* Use clear, minimal icons for:  
  * Moves (chess piece, handshake, lightning bolt)  
  * Roles (briefcase \= CRO, shield \= Risk Officer, scale \= Regulator)  
  * Signal states (check, warning, cross)

## **Inspiration Notes**

* Think *War Room meets Westworld UI*  
* Influence from:  
  * **Figma/Miro maps** for spatial clarity  
  * **Civ-style node views** for agent states  
  * **Narrative dashboards** for high-level story arcs

Catalyst‚Äôs design must deliver more than function‚Äîit must convey *strategic gravity*. Every interaction should feel like part of a consequential simulation, reflecting the ripple effects of every move in the ecosystem.
